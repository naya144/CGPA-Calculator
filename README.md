## Features

- **Multi-Subject Support**: Allows users to input grades and credit hours for multiple subjects and calculates the CGPA accordingly.
  
- **Flexible Grading System**: Supports customizable grading scales (e.g., 4.0, 10-point scale) and can be adjusted as needed.
  
- **Credit Hour Weighting**: Considers both the grade achieved and the number of credit hours for each subject, ensuring a weighted average calculation for the CGPA.

- **User-Friendly Command-Line Interface**: Designed for simplicity, the program interacts with the user through easy-to-follow prompts for grade and credit hour input.

- **Grade-to-GPA Mapping**: Automatically converts letter grades (e.g., `A`, `B+`, `C`) to their respective grade points based on a standard scale.

- **Real-Time CGPA Calculation**: After inputting the grades and credit hours, the CGPA is calculated and displayed in real-time.

- **Error Handling**: Includes basic validation for input, such as ensuring the grade is valid (e.g., `A`, `B+`, `C-`) and the credit hours are positive integers.

- **Extensibility**: The project is easily extendable to support additional features, such as different grading scales, GPA to CGPA conversion, or output formatting options.

- **No External Dependencies**: The program works out of the box without requiring any external libraries (besides Python itself), making it lightweight and easy to run.

- **Customizable Output**: The result is shown in a clear format, and the program can be customized to display more detailed reports, such as the GPA for individual subjects or semester-wise CGPA.

- **Cross-Platform**: Works on any system with Python 3.x installed (Windows, macOS, Linux).
